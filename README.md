# Mean-Corpuscular-Hemoglobin
Python code that calculates the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) in actual condition
In this code, the calculate_mch function takes two arguments: hemoglobin and red_blood_cells. It divides the hemoglobin value by the red blood cell count and then multiplies it by 10 to get the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH). The calculated MCH value is then returned by the function.

In the example usage section, I've provided sample values for hemoglobin_level and red_blood_cell_count, and called the calculate_mch function with these values. The calculated MCH value is then printed as output.

Note: This code assumes that the input values are provided in the correct units (grams and millions respectively) and the formula used to calculate MCH is appropriate for your actual condition.

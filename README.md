## Introduction
Welcome to the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) Calculator! This Python code calculates the MCH value based on the provided hemoglobin and red blood cell count. MCH is an important parameter used in medical diagnostics to evaluate the average amount of hemoglobin present in each red blood cell.

## Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) is a measure of the average amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell. It is calculated by dividing the total amount hemoglobin by the number of red blood cells and multiplying by 10. MCH values are typically reported in picograms (pg).

MCH is an essential component of a complete blood count (CBC) test and provides valuable information about the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. Abnormal MCH levels can indicate various conditions, such as anemia or vitamin deficiencies.

## Usage
To use this code, follow the steps below:

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mch-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd mch-calculator
   ```

### Running the Code
1. Open the `calculate_mch.py` file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

2. Modify the values of `hemoglobin_level` and `red_blood_cell_count` variables with your own data. Ensure that the units are correct (hemoglobin in grams and red blood cell count in millions).

3. Save the file.

4. Run the script.

5. The calculated MCH value will be displayed as output.
